---------------------------------------------------------
Files in this folder:
	
	Folders:
	1- bottlenecks: contains bottlenecks, generated by the inception network retraining
	2- inception: contains the inception network
	3- log: contains the results
	4- plasterWork: contains the training samples in different folders
	5- scanned: images taken from the camear
	6- tiles: contains the tiles made of the source images
	7- training image sets: contains the sample images and the illustrator files to generate the training tiles

	Codes:
	8- ImageClassifier.ipynb: classifies the tiles in the tiles folder and classifies them in the log folder
	9- sampleCollector.py: converts images in scanned folder into tiles in the tiles folder

	generated files:
	10- retrained_graph.pb: graph generated by retraining process
	11- retrained_labels.txt: labels generated by retraining process


Retrain the Inception model with images in the ImageClassification folder:
---------------------------------------------------------
In comamnd line navigate to the ImageClassification folder and run this script, while all your images are stored in the ImageClassification folder. Every image should be manually organized in a folder with the same name as their tags.

Python3 image_retraining/retrain.py --bottleneck_dir=bottlenecksÂ  --model_dir=inception --output_graph=retrained_graph.pb --output_labels=retrained_labels.txt --image_dir plasterWork
